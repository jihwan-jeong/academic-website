Hi :smile:! &nbsp; I'm a Ph.D. candidate and a member of the D3M (**D**ata-**D**riven **D**ecision-making) lab at University of Toronto working with Professor [Scott Sanner](https://d3m.mie.utoronto.ca).  I started my research career as an AI/ML researcher since I was fascinated by the prospect of building tools that can aid and optimize various decision-making problems.  I've worked on a variety of topics in the past 3 years, and the encompassing theme is **robust decision-making with (learned) models**.  These days, my main research interest is in offline model-based reinforcement learning (for example, check out this [preprint work](project/cbop)).  Specifically, I am very interested in how to use Bayesian models for robust planning at test time or for learning an effective policy, by taking the epistemic uncertainty of the model into account.  Prior to coming to Toronto, I did my master's at KAIST in South Korea under the supervision of Professor [Hayong Shin](http://sal.kaist.ac.kr).
