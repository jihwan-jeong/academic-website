abstract: Continual learning is a branch of deep learning that seeks to strike a balance between learning stability and plasticity. The CVPR 2020 CLVision Continual Learning for Computer Vision challenge is dedicated to evaluating and advancing the current state-of-the-art continual learning methods using the CORe50 dataset with three different continual learning scenarios. This paper presents our approach, called Batch-level Experience Replay with Review, to this challenge. Our team achieved the 1â€™st place in all three scenarios out of 79 participated teams 1. The codebase of our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/RaptorMai/CVPR20_CLVision_challenge.
